# sequence_classification
Sequence classification involves predicting a class label for a given input sequence.

The original project was to perform human activities recognition based on Multimodal Human Action Dataset.
Basically is the fusion of various types of data which is depth, rgb, inertial and skeleton data.

My team objective was to improve the performance of the original project and the
classification of human activities was only based on the sequence of inertial data and skeleton data collected when subject performed certain activities.

Sample code and some reference documents was given beforehand.

What had been done were 
1) Getting the code to work again as some of the functions was deprecated 
2) Clean up the code to make it more maintainable
3) Added in new features 
4) Provided more comments in the code for better understanding
